# NOMAD-14 Processing tasks

## Overview
Enhance the existing task-processing script to automatically detect queued tasks, transition their status through execution phases, invoke the Claude engine with a predefined prompt, handle task file copying for multi-queue scenarios, and provide real-time feedback updates to users. This improves operational efficiency and visibility into long-running automated workflows.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **AC1:** Codebase Recon completed; relevant script(s), ticket/status data stores, task file structure, and integration points identified and documented.  
- [ ] **AC2:** Script correctly transitions ticket statuses (“Queued to run” → “In progress” → “Done”), invokes the Claude engine prompt, handles multiple queued tasks, and updates the Feedback property at each processing step, with regression-safe tests.  
- [ ] **AC3:** End-to-end execution completes within agreed SLA (e.g., total processing time below threshold for X tasks) and memory/CPU usage remains within acceptable bounds; performance metrics documented.

## Technical Requirements

### Core Functionality
- **Codebase Recon:** Analyze the existing codebase to locate the task-processing script, ticket/status storage modules, and the tasks/tasks directory; map out how statuses and Feedback properties are read/updated and how external LLM engines are invoked.  
- Implement detection of tickets with status “Queued to run” within the existing status management interface.  
- Update ticket status to “In progress” before task execution begins.  
- Invoke the Claude engine, bypassing permission checks, with prompt:  
  “Process all tasks from the task master, don’t stop unless you finish all of the tasks, after that close the app.”  
- After the Claude execution completes, update the ticket status to “Done.”  
- If more than one task is queued:  
  - Retrieve the first ticket’s ID from its properties.  
  - Locate the corresponding file at `tasks/tasks/<id>.json`.  
  - Copy it to `<parent_directory>/.taskmaster/tasks/tasks.json` using existing file utilities.  
- Add Feedback updates at each stage—refining, preparing, processing, copying, finalizing—by updating the ticket’s Feedback property.

### Integration Points
- The existing task-processing script/module in `<path_to_scripts>` (to be discovered).  
- Ticket/status management interfaces or modules where statuses and properties are stored (database models or file-based storage).  
- File system utilities for locating and copying JSON task files.  
- External LLM invocation mechanism for the Claude engine.

### Data Requirements
- No schema additions beyond ensuring each ticket record has a Feedback field capable of holding status messages.  
- Ensure that task JSON files under `tasks/tasks/` conform to the expected structure used by the script.  
- Validate that the copied `tasks.json` matches the schema consumed by downstream logic.  
- Add basic validation for ticket ID existence and file path availability.

## Implementation Approach

### Architecture & Design
- Extend the existing task-processing script:  
  1. Discover queued tickets via the status module.  
  2. Update status and Feedback property through the same interfaces currently used for manual updates.  
  3. Invoke the Claude engine via the existing LLM integration layer, passing the static prompt.  
  4. Handle file-level operations with current file-utility components.  
  5. Commit final status update and Feedback.  
- Apply the Command Pattern for each processing step to encapsulate status transitions and feedback updates.  
- Use the existing logging/tracing facility to correlate feedback updates with system logs.

## Performance & Scalability
- Target processing latency: under X seconds per task for Y concurrent tasks.  
- Ensure memory usage remains linear to task size; reuse in-memory data structures where possible.  
- For bulk task loads, implement batching or streaming to avoid large file copies in one shot.  
- Leverage existing caching layers (if any) to avoid repeated file system lookups.

## Security Considerations
- Bypassing permission checks for the Claude engine increases risk; ensure invocation is limited to a secured runtime context.  
- Validate and sanitize file paths before performing copy operations to prevent path traversal.  
- Ensure Feedback updates do not expose sensitive data from task contents or engine responses.  
- Audit trails must capture each status transition and Claude invocation.

## Complexity Estimate
**Medium** - Requires recon of existing scripting modules, integration with status/Feedback interfaces, careful orchestration of file operations, and secure LLM invocation.

## Additional Notes
- Information Needed:  
  - Exact file path(s) of the current task-processing script and task/status storage modules.  
  - Location and structure of ticket records (database tables or JSON files).  
  - Access mechanism for invoking the Claude engine in the codebase.  
- Dependencies on other tickets/features: none identified yet.  
- Potential risks and mitigation strategies:  
  - Unhandled failures in the Claude engine → implement retry logic and error-status updates.  
  - File I/O errors during copy → validate permissions and disk space ahead of time.  
- Future enhancement considerations:  
  - Dynamic prompt configuration per task type.  
  - Parallel processing of multiple queued tasks.
