# NOMAD-9 Organize code repository structure

## Overview
Reorganize the existing codebase into a clear, modular directory structure with self-explanatory names, consolidate `main.py` and `main_workflow.py` into a single entry point, and standardize logging to emit timestamped session logs under `./logs`. This will improve developer onboarding, maintainability, and consistency.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **AC1:** Codebase Recon completed; relevant modules/files/services, integration points, and impacted dependencies identified and documented.  
- [ ] **AC2:** Repository refactored with new directory layout, clients grouped, other modules relocated, and single unified entry point implemented. Regression-safe tests in place.  
- [ ] **AC3:** Logging standardized using existing logger conventions, sessions write to `./logs/<timestamp>.log`, and performance verified to meet existing response targets.

## Technical Requirements

### Core Functionality
- **Codebase Recon:** Analyze the existing repository to identify:
  - Current top-level scripts (`main.py`, `main_workflow.py`), subdirectories, and loose files.
  - Client-related code segments and other feature modules.
  - Test suites and configuration files.
- Define the new directory structure:
  - `/clients/` for all client integrations.
  - `/core/` or `/services/` for business logic modules.
  - `/utils/` for utilities/helpers.
  - `/entry/` or `/app/` for the unified entry point file.
- Interfaces/contracts:
  - Identify function/classes exposed by client modules and adjust import paths.
  - Merge existing workflow orchestration logic into the new entry point interface.
- Input/output formats:
  - Validate that command-line arguments or configuration file inputs continue to be parsed correctly.
  - Ensure output artifacts (files, API responses) preserve current structure.

### Integration Points
- Modify invocation references in build/deploy scripts or pipelines to point at the unified entry.
- Update import paths across all modules to align with the new directory layout.
- Adjust test fixtures and mocks to reference relocated modules.
- Ensure the existing logger initialization is used and extended to support file handlers writing to `./logs`.

### Data Requirements
- No schema changes; focus is on file organization.
- No data migrations; validate that any relative paths to data/config files are updated after relocation.
- Validate that log file creation adheres to naming convention: `<YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS>.log`.

## Implementation Approach

### Architecture & Design
- Adopt a layered structure: entry → orchestration → service modules → utilities.
- Use the Facade pattern in the new entry point to hide merging details of previous mains.
- Refactor clients to implement a common interface (e.g., `Client.execute()`), simplifying integration.
- Leverage Dependency Injection principles to wire together logger, configuration, and modules.

## Performance & Scalability
- Maintain existing startup and execution time within a 5% variance of baseline.
- Directory reorganization should have negligible runtime impact.
- No additional runtime dependencies introduced.

## Security Considerations
- Ensure sensitive information is not logged; adhere to existing redaction practices.
- Log files in `./logs` must have appropriate filesystem permissions to prevent unauthorized access.
- Verify that merged entry point does not expose new attack surfaces.

## Complexity Estimate
**Medium** – Involves refactoring imports and entry points, relocating multiple modules, and consolidating logging behavior without altering business logic.

## Additional Notes
- Information Needed:
  - Complete list of client modules/files to relocate.
  - Existing logger configuration details (formatters, handlers) to mirror in file handler.
  - Confirmation on naming conventions for new directories.
  - Any CI/CD scripts that reference old paths.
- Dependencies:
  - May conflict with open refactor tickets touching the same modules.
- Risks & Mitigations:
  - Broken imports: mitigate with comprehensive import tests.
  - Logging misconfiguration: add smoke test to validate log file creation.
- Future Enhancements:
  - Introduce automated linting rule to enforce directory conventions.
  - Implement dynamic plugin discovery for clients.
