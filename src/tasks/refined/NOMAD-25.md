# NOMAD-25 Branching

## Overview
This feature enhances the existing task management functionality by implementing a check for a "new branch" checkbox associated with tasks/pages. If the checkbox is checked, a new branch will be created using the task name before proceeding with any other operations. This improvement supports better version control and task organization.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **AC1:** Codebase Recon completed; relevant modules/files/services, integration points, and impacted dependencies identified and documented.
- [ ] **AC2:** Feature behavior implemented and verified within existing architecture with regression-safe tests.
- [ ] **AC3:** Performance/quality requirement measured with agreed thresholds and documented.

## Technical Requirements

### Core Functionality
- **Codebase Recon:** Analyze the existing codebase to identify relevant modules, files, or services and their connections. This includes:
  - Locating the handling of tasks/pages within the codebase.
  - Identifying the checkbox logic for the "new branch" feature.
- Define technical specifications to implement the feature within the current architecture.
- Update interfaces/contracts related to task management to include the new branch logic.
- Input/output formats and validation rules for the task name and checkbox state.

### Integration Points
- Identify the modules responsible for task management and branching operations.
- Determine any internal interfaces or data flows impacted by this new feature.
- Document any dependencies and version constraints related to the branching logic.

### Data Requirements
- Assess if schema or data model changes are needed for managing branch names.
- Document any data validation and constraints required for the task name.

## Implementation Approach

### Architecture & Design
- Develop a high-level design that integrates seamlessly with the existing architecture for task management.
- Utilize established design patterns appropriate for branching and task handling.
- Define the interaction flow between the task handling component and the branching logic within the current system boundaries.

## Performance & Scalability

- Analyze the expected load and performance targets associated with creating branches on task conditions.
- Consider scalability for a growing number of tasks and associated branches.
- Estimate resource utilization when creating branches.

## Security Considerations

- Evaluate authentication/authorization impacts related to branching operations.
- Address data protection and privacy concerns tied to task names and branch creation.
- Identify any potential security vulnerabilities and compliance requirements.

## Complexity Estimate
**Medium** - The complexity level is derived from the need to integrate branching functionality with existing task management features while ensuring compatibility across the system.

## Additional Notes
- Information Needed:
  - Verification of existing task management logic to identify integration points.
  - Understanding of current user permissions related to branch creation.
  - Insights on naming conventions and possible conflicts with existing branches.
- Dependencies on other tickets/features that might affect task or branching logic.
- Potential risks associated with branch name collisions and mitigation strategies.
- Future enhancement considerations regarding branching strategies or user settings.
