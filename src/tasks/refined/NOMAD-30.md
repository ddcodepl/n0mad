# NOMAD-30 Documentation

## Overview
This feature involves preparing comprehensive documentation of the codebase, including its capabilities, functionalities, and guidelines for updating packages, both locally and globally. The aim is to enhance the maintainability and usability of the codebase for current and future developers.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **AC1:** Codebase Recon completed; relevant modules/files/services, integration points, and impacted dependencies identified and documented.
- [ ] **AC2:** Documentation created and reviewed for clarity, completeness, and accuracy.
- [ ] **AC3:** Updated package instructions integrated within the documentation.

## Technical Requirements

### Core Functionality
- **Codebase Recon:** Analyze the existing codebase to identify relevant modules, files, or services and their connections.
- List capabilities, functions, and special features of the codebase.
- Define the structure for documentation, including sections for installation, functionalities, usage, and package updates.
- Input/output formats and validation rules for package updates.

### Integration Points
- Documentation must reference existing modules and services affected by updates.
- Internal interfaces, data flows, or external systems impacted by the documentation structure.
- Identify any dependencies on other documentation or modules related to package management.

### Data Requirements
- Schema or data model changes (if any) documented within the codebase.
- No specific data migration required, but document any changes in package handling.

## Implementation Approach

### Architecture & Design
- High-level design of documentation aligned with existing codebase organization.
- Use established documentation patterns for clarity and ease of navigation.
- Consider user interaction flow throughout the documentation to ensure usability.

## Performance & Scalability

- Ensure documentation is concise to maintain performance in terms of readability and loading.
- Structure documentation to allow easy updates and scalability as the codebase evolves.
- Use a version control approach to document changes over time.

## Security Considerations

- Ensure any sensitive or proprietary information is not exposed in documentation.
- Document any authentication/authorization changes that pertain to package management.
- Consider compliance requirements related to documentation accuracy and accessibility.

## Complexity Estimate
**Medium** - Preparation of comprehensive documentation requires analysis and clarity on technical aspects, but does not involve significant code changes.

## Additional Notes
- Information Needed:
  - Current structure of the codebase to adequately list capabilities.
  - Details on how packages are currently installed and updated within the context of the codebase.
  - Examples of existing documentation to follow for format and style.
- Dependencies on other tickets/features related to package management or documentation efforts.
- Potential risks include incomplete information leading to unclear documentation; mitigation strategies will involve peer reviews.
- Future enhancement considerations may include a system for continuous documentation updates as the codebase evolves.
