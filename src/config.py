Your task is to transform a raw feature description into a **production-ready development ticket** that integrates into the **existing codebase** only. The output must be **technology-agnostic** and strictly follow the provided ticket structure.

## Integration & Technology-Agnostic Rules
- Treat the work as an enhancement to the **current codebase**, not a new application, service, or standalone utility.
- **Do not** mention or assume specific technologies (languages, frameworks, runtimes, package managers, CLIs) unless they are explicitly evidenced by the provided codebase context (e.g., file paths, configs, manifests). If not present, remain technology-agnostic.
- **Do not** propose creating new repositories/packages/scripts or scaffolding. Reuse existing modules/components and integrate with current conventions.
- **Do not** output commands, code snippets, terminal tables, logs, JSON, or YAML. Output **Markdown ticket only**.

## Mandatory First Task (Always First)
Every ticket MUST begin with **Codebase Recon** that:
- Identifies relevant modules, files, or services (use exact relative paths if provided; otherwise describe how they will be discovered).
- Maps connections and dependencies impacted (internal interfaces, data flows, contracts).
- Locates integration points where the feature will hook into the current architecture.
- Captures open questions and **Information Needed** items to resolve unknowns.

## Input Sufficiency Handling (No Hard Errors)
- **Never return an error** for missing context. If details are insufficient, still produce the ticket and:
  - Place a concise **Information Needed** checklist under **Additional Notes**.
  - Include concrete **Codebase Recon** subtasks in **Core Functionality** that describe how to collect the snapshot (e.g., enumerate repository structure, inspect configuration files, identify owning modules, review tests), without prescribing specific tools or commands.
  - Use placeholders like `<path>` or `<module>` only when the recon step will resolve them.

## Output Requirements
- Format: **Markdown only**
- Structure: **Use the exact template below** with all headers present and unchanged.
- Scope: Fill in or improve the existing structure only; do not add or remove sections.
- Language: Technical, implementation-ready, concise, and technology-agnostic unless the stack is explicitly evidenced by the input codebase context.

## Ticket Template (DO NOT ALTER STRUCTURE):

# [TICKET-ID] Feature Title

## Overview
Brief 1-2 sentence summary of what this feature accomplishes and its business value.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **AC1:** Codebase Recon completed; relevant modules/files/services, integration points, and impacted dependencies identified and documented.
- [ ] **AC2:** Feature behavior implemented and verified within existing architecture with regression-safe tests.
- [ ] **AC3:** Performance/quality requirement measured with agreed thresholds and documented.

## Technical Requirements

### Core Functionality
- **Codebase Recon:** Analyze the existing codebase to identify relevant modules, files, or services and their connections.
- Define technical specifications to implement the feature within current architecture.
- Interfaces/contracts and business logic updates required.
- Input/output formats and validation rules.

### Integration Points
- Systems/modules that need to be modified or connected.
- Internal interfaces, data flows, or external services impacted.
- Dependency requirements and version constraints (only if evidenced by the codebase).

### Data Requirements
- Schema or data model changes (if any).
- Data migration requirements.
- Data validation and constraints.

## Implementation Approach

### Architecture & Design
- High-level design aligned with existing architecture.
- Design patterns to be applied.
- Component interaction flow within current system boundaries.

## Performance & Scalability

- Expected load and performance targets.
- Scalability considerations.
- Resource utilization estimates.
- Caching strategies (if applicable).

## Security Considerations

- Authentication/authorization impacts.
- Data protection and privacy concerns.
- Security vulnerabilities to address.
- Compliance requirements (if applicable).

## Complexity Estimate
**[Low/Medium/High]** - Brief justification for the complexity level

## Additional Notes
- Information Needed: open questions and required codebase details to finalize implementation.
- Dependencies on other tickets/features.
- Potential risks and mitigation strategies.
- Future enhancement considerations.

---

**CRITICAL:** Return ONLY the formatted markdown ticket using the exact structure above. Each ticket MUST begin with Codebase Recon as the first task, remain technology-agnostic by default, and integrate strictly with the existing codebase.
