NOMAD-31 Dockerization

Overview
This feature prepares Docker images and Docker Compose configurations for the existing application, enabling a streamlined development environment with Python 3.11 support. It enhances the deployment process and provides consistency across various environments.

Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **AC1:** Codebase Recon completed; relevant modules/files/services, integration points, and impacted dependencies identified and documented.
- [ ] **AC2:** Docker images and Docker Compose configurations implemented and verified within existing architecture with regression-safe tests.
- [ ] **AC3:** Performance/quality requirement measured with agreed thresholds and documented.

Technical Requirements

Core Functionality
- **Codebase Recon:** Analyze the existing codebase to identify relevant modules, files, or services and their connections. This may include elements such as:
  - Reviewing existing configuration files and folder structures 
  - Locating any build scripts that might integrate with Docker
  - Identifying the current application architecture and module responsibilities
- Define technical specifications to implement Dockerization, including necessary adjustments for Python 3.11 dependencies.
- Interfaces/contracts and business logic updates required to ensure compatibility within Docker containers.
- Input/output formats and validation rules to maintain functionality during Dockerization.

Integration Points
- Identify systems/modules that may require changes due to Dockerization, including service connections affected by containerization.
- Outline internal interfaces and data flows that need adjusting to accommodate a containerized environment.
- Identify dependency requirements and version constraints, particularly for Python and any libraries that are integral to the application.

Data Requirements
- Determine if there are any changes needed in the data schema or data model to ensure smooth operation within Docker containers.
- Identify data migration requirements if applicable.
- Establish data validation and constraints as they pertain to the containerized deployment.

Implementation Approach

Architecture & Design
- High-level design aligned with the existing application architecture to support Dockerization.
- Design patterns to be employed that facilitate container interoperability and service discovery.
- Component interaction flow within current system boundaries, outlining how interconnected services will communicate in a Dockerized environment.

Performance & Scalability

Define expected load and performance targets for the Dockerized application.
- Assess scalability considerations to ensure the system can handle projected growth in users or data.
- Estimate resource utilization within Docker containers to optimize performance.
- Evaluate caching strategies needed within the containerized setup (if applicable).

Security Considerations

Review impacts on authentication/authorization in a Dockerized context.
- Address any data protection and privacy concerns that arise from the use of containers.
- Identify security vulnerabilities associated with Dockerizing the application and establish mitigation strategies.
- Assess compliance requirements relevant to the system operating inside containers.

Complexity Estimate
**Medium** - The complexity arises from integrating Dockerization into the existing architecture while ensuring compatibility with current dependencies and workflows.

Additional Notes
- Information Needed: open questions and required codebase details to finalize implementation, including:
  - Current Dockerfile and Docker Compose configuration examples if they exist.
  - Existing dependencies that may need specific handling for compatibility with Python 3.11.
- Dependencies on other tickets/features related to deployment or infrastructure.
- Potential risks include misconfigurations affecting the applicationâ€™s functionality in containers, with mitigation strategies to be determined.
- Future enhancement considerations for optimizing the Docker environment, such as multi-stage builds or using specific orchestration tools.
