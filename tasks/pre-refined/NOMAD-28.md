NOMAD-28 Commit Changes

Overview
This feature allows the system to check for a "Checkbox commit" on the task page. Once all tasks with the status "in progress" are completed, it generates a concise and informative commit summarizing the changes.

Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **AC1:** Codebase Recon completed; relevant modules/files/services, integration points, and impacted dependencies identified and documented.
- [ ] **AC2:** Feature behavior implemented and verified within existing architecture with regression-safe tests.
- [ ] **AC3:** Performance/quality requirement measured with agreed thresholds and documented.

Technical Requirements

Core Functionality
- **Codebase Recon:** Analyze the existing codebase to identify relevant modules, files, or services that manage task statuses and commits. This could involve reviewing task management modules and commit handling components.
- Define technical specifications to implement the feature to check for the "Checkbox commit" and generate commit messages.
- Review and possibly update interfaces/contracts that manage task data and commit messages.
- Determine input/output formats for the commit message and any necessary validation rules.

Integration Points
- Identify task management modules that need to be modified to include the checkbox behavior.
- Evaluate internal interfaces that deal with task statuses and commit generation.
- Understand how task completion impacts commit history or behavior in the current system.

Data Requirements
- Verify if there are any schema or data model changes required to support the checkbox and commit functionality.
- Identify any data migration requirements, if applicable, for integrating the new functionality.
- Ensure data validation rules for commit messages are established and clear.

Implementation Approach

Architecture & Design
- Propose a design that aligns with the existing architecture of task management and version control within the application.
- Identify design patterns suitable for task completion tracking and commit summarization.
- Describe how components will interact, especially between task completion and commit generation mechanisms.

Performance & Scalability

Define expected load and performance targets for handling task status checks and commit generations.
- Consider scalability implications if numerous tasks are processed simultaneously.
- Assess resource utilization during the commit generation process.
- Evaluate the need for caching strategies for repeated commit generation requests.

Security Considerations

Review implications on authentication and authorization for managing task changes and commits.
- Assess data protection measures around commit messages, especially if they contain user-generated content.
- Identify any potential security vulnerabilities that may arise from task status changes and commit actions.
- Ensure compliance with any relevant industry standards and regulations.

Complexity Estimate
**Medium** - The complexity arises from integrating the checkbox functionality with the existing task management logic and ensuring reliable commit generation.

Additional Notes
- Information Needed:
  - Details on the existing task management module structure.
  - Clarity on how commits are currently managed and generated.
  - Any relevant user stories or acceptance criteria associated with the commit process.
- Dependencies on other tickets/features should be identified for a coordinated implementation.
- Potential risks include incorrect task status detection or commit generation failure. Developing robust error handling and logging can mitigate these risks.
- Future enhancements could include user-configurable commit message templates or additional automation features related to task management.
