# NOMAD-31 Dockerization

## Overview
This feature prepares Docker images and Docker Compose configurations for the existing application, enabling a streamlined development environment with Python 3.11 support. It enhances the deployment process and provides consistency across various environments.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **AC1:** Codebase Recon completed; relevant modules/files/services, integration points, and impacted dependencies identified and documented.
- [ ] **AC2:** Docker images and Docker Compose configurations implemented and verified within existing architecture with regression-safe tests.
- [ ] **AC3:** Performance/quality requirement measured with agreed thresholds and documented.

## Technical Requirements

### Core Functionality
- **Codebase Recon:** Analyze the existing codebase to identify relevant modules, files, or services and their connections.
  - Review existing configuration files and folder structures within the repository.
  - Locate any build scripts that might integrate with Docker and identify the corresponding file paths.
  - Identify the current application architecture and module responsibilities by reviewing documentation and code structure.
- Define technical specifications to implement Dockerization, including necessary adjustments for Python 3.11 dependencies.
- Update interfaces/contracts and business logic to ensure compatibility within Docker containers.
- Establish input/output formats and validation rules to maintain functionality during Dockerization.

### Integration Points
- Identify systems/modules that may require changes due to Dockerization, particularly those with service connections affected by containerization.
- Outline internal interfaces and data flows needing adjustments to accommodate a containerized environment.
- Identify dependency requirements and version constraints, particularly for essential libraries and Python itself.

### Data Requirements
- Determine if there are any changes needed in the data schema or data model to ensure smooth operation within Docker containers.
- Identify data migration requirements, if applicable, to facilitate the container transition.
- Establish data validation and constraints as they pertain to the containerized deployment.

## Implementation Approach

### Architecture & Design
- High-level design aligned with the existing application architecture to support Dockerization.
- Apply design patterns that facilitate container interoperability and service discovery.
- Outline the component interaction flow within current system boundaries, ensuring clarity on how interconnected services will communicate in a Dockerized environment.

## Performance & Scalability

- Define expected load and performance targets for the Dockerized application.
- Assess scalability considerations to ensure the system can handle projected growth in users or data.
- Estimate resource utilization within Docker containers to optimize performance.
- Evaluate caching strategies needed within the containerized setup, if applicable.

## Security Considerations

- Review impacts on authentication/authorization in a Dockerized context to ensure secure access controls.
- Address any data protection and privacy concerns arising from the use of containers.
- Identify potential security vulnerabilities associated with Dockerizing the application and develop mitigation strategies.
- Assess compliance requirements relevant to the system operating within containers.

## Complexity Estimate
**Medium** - The complexity arises from integrating Dockerization into the existing architecture while ensuring compatibility with current dependencies and workflows.

## Additional Notes
- Information Needed: open questions and required codebase details to finalize implementation, including:
  - Current Dockerfile and Docker Compose configuration examples, if they exist.
  - Existing dependencies that may need specific handling for compatibility with Python 3.11.
- Identify dependencies on other tickets/features related to deployment or infrastructure.
- Assess potential risks, including misconfigurations affecting application functionality within containers, and outline corresponding mitigation strategies.
- Consider future enhancements for optimizing the Docker environment, such as multi-stage builds or integration with orchestration tools.
