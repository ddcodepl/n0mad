NOMAD-29 Add Slack Integration for Task Status Notifications

Overview
This feature enhances the existing system by integrating Slack notifications that inform users whenever a task status changes. It aims to improve communication and ensure stakeholders are promptly updated about task progress.

Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **AC1:** Codebase Recon completed; relevant modules/files/services, integration points, and impacted dependencies identified and documented.
- [ ] **AC2:** Feature behavior implemented and verified within existing architecture with regression-safe tests.
- [ ] **AC3:** Performance/quality requirement measured with agreed thresholds and documented.

Technical Requirements

Core Functionality
- **Codebase Recon:** Analyze the existing codebase to identify relevant modules, files, or services and their connections, specifically focusing on areas handling task statuses and notifications.
- Define technical specifications for capturing task status changes and sending notifications to Slack.
- Update any necessary interfaces/contracts to accommodate Slack message formatting.
- Establish input/output formats for notifications, ensuring they align with user expectations for clarity and friendliness.

Integration Points
- Identify modules responsible for task management and mutation.
- Determine how task status events trigger notifications and the structure of those notifications.
- Assess dependencies related to the Slack integration, including the possible need for configuration updates.

Data Requirements
- Review any environment variable requirements for Slack token and channel details.
- Ensure data for notifications complies with validation rules for any outgoing messages.

Implementation Approach

Architecture & Design
- Design an integration layer that abstracts Slack API interactions to maintain testability and separation of concerns.
- Apply design patterns consistent with the current architecture, such as Observer or Event-Driven, to handle task status updates.
- Detail the flow of data from task status changes through to Slack message dispatch.

Performance & Scalability

Set expectations for notification frequency based on task status changes.
- Assess scalability of the integration if task changes become more frequent or additional notifications are required.
- Evaluate resource utilization in the context of invoking external API calls.

Security Considerations

Ensure proper storage and access controls for the Slack token.
- Address potential security vulnerabilities related to data exposure in messages.
- Consider compliance requirements regarding user notifications and data handling.

Complexity Estimate
**Medium** - The complexity arises from the need to integrate with an external service and ensure seamless communication while maintaining existing functionality.

Additional Notes
- Information Needed:
  - Confirmation of the acceptable message format for Slack notifications.
  - Confirmation on how to identify task status change events within the existing code.
- Dependencies on other tickets/features, particularly any related to task management.
- Potential risks include dependency on the reliability of the Slack API and message delivery.
- Future enhancement considerations might include user preferences for notification subscriptions.
