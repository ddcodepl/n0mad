NOMAD-22 Prepare script so I can install it as global app and run in any directory

Overview
This feature enables the global installation of a Python package, allowing it to be executed from any directory. It also incorporates the ability to configure various environment variables for customization.

Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **AC1:** Codebase Recon completed; relevant modules/files/services, integration points, and impacted dependencies identified and documented.
- [ ] **AC2:** Feature behavior implemented and verified within existing architecture with regression-safe tests.
- [ ] **AC3:** Performance/quality requirement measured with agreed thresholds and documented.

Technical Requirements

Core Functionality
- **Codebase Recon:** Analyze the existing codebase to identify relevant modules, files, or services that facilitate script execution and packaging.
  - Investigate potential locations such as `<package-directory>/setup.py`, `<package-directory>/install.sh`, or equivalent configuration files to determine existing packaging strategies and execution hooks.
- Define technical specifications to implement global installation functionality within the current architecture.
- Update interfaces/contracts to include management of new environment variables.
- Specify input/output formats and validation rules for environment variable configuration.

Integration Points
- Systems/modules that need to be modified or connected include:
  - Current package management configuration to support global installation.
- Internal interfaces, data flows, or external services impacted:
  - Integration with existing environment variable reading mechanisms.
- Dependency requirements and version constraints (only if evidenced by the codebase).

Data Requirements
- Updates to environment variable handling to include:
  - `TASKMASTER_DIR`
  - `TASKS_DIR`
  - `NOTION_TOKEN`
  - `NOTION_BOARD_DB`
  - `OPENAI_API_KEY`
  - `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`
- Define validation rules for the presence and format of these environment variables.

Implementation Approach

Architecture & Design
- High-level design to ensure the package can be installed globally while remaining compliant with existing architecture standards.
- Design patterns involving environment configuration and access patterns.
- Component interaction flow: from environment variable definitions to script execution.

Performance & Scalability

Expected load and performance targets established for the execution of scripts using these environment variables.
- Scalability considerations for handling varying loads based on user-defined directories and tasks.
- Resource utilization estimates during execution based on environment variable configurations.
- Caching strategies (if applicable) to minimize overhead when accessing environment settings.

Security Considerations

Authentication/authorization impacts related to the integration of environment variables containing sensitive tokens.
- Data protection and privacy concerns regarding the storage and retrieval of sensitive API keys.
- Identification of potential security vulnerabilities in environment variable management.
- Compliance requirements for handling API keys during execution.

Complexity Estimate
**Medium** - The complexity is moderate due to the need to integrate global installation processes and secure handling of multiple environment variables.

Additional Notes
- Information Needed:
  - Clarification on the current package management system in use.
  - Details on existing environment variable management patterns.
  - Insight on potential conflicts with existing global installations.
- Dependencies on other tickets/features related to installation and configuration.
- Potential risks in execution due to unauthorized access to sensitive information and mitigation strategies for data protection.
- Future enhancement considerations for user feedback on environment settings.
