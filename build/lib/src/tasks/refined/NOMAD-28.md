# NOMAD-28 Commit Changes

## Overview
This feature enhances the current workflow by ensuring that tasks marked as in progress are only moved to finished status after verifying the presence of a "Commit" checkbox in the linked Notion page. If the checkbox is checked, a concise, informative commit message including the ticket number will be prepared and committed without pushing to the repository.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **AC1:** Codebase Recon completed; relevant modules/files/services, integration points, and impacted dependencies identified and documented.
- [ ] **AC2:** Feature behavior implemented and verified within existing architecture with regression-safe tests.
- [ ] **AC3:** Performance/quality requirement measured with agreed thresholds and documented.

## Technical Requirements

### Core Functionality
- **Codebase Recon:** Analyze the existing codebase to identify relevant modules, files, or services involved in task status management and Notion integration.
- Define technical specifications to implement the feature, including condition checks for the "Commit" checkbox and commit message formatting.
- Update interfaces/contracts related to task status transitions and commit processes.
- Establish input/output formats for commit messages and validation rules for task statuses.

### Integration Points
- Identify existing modules responsible for task management and status transitions.
- Determine how the Notion integration is currently implemented and any APIs or services used for interactions.
- Assess how commit actions are currently handled within the codebase to slot in the new functionality.

### Data Requirements
- Review any related data models for tasks to ensure the addition of the “Commit” checkbox is reflected appropriately.
- Identify any necessary data validation rules related to task status changes and commit messages.

## Implementation Approach

### Architecture & Design
- Align the new feature with existing task management architecture and Notion integration.
- Consider patterns such as state management for task transitions and observer patterns for checkbox state changes.
- Outline a component interaction flow that captures the process of verifying the checkbox and formulating the commit message.

## Performance & Scalability

- Anticipate load and performance targets related to user interactions with tasks and Notion page checks.
- Assess scalability needs if task management volume increases; consider potential caching for checkbox state retrieval.

## Security Considerations

- Ensure that the processes for checking the Notion page and preparing commits adhere to authentication and authorization standards.
- Address any data protection concerns relating to task information being committed.
- Verify compliance with relevant data privacy regulations.

## Complexity Estimate
**Medium** - The complexity involves integrating new behavior into existing workflows, ensuring proper checks, and handling commit operations without pushing.

## Additional Notes
- Information Needed: open questions about the structure of the Notion API, existing commit handling processes, and task management workflows to finalize implementation.
- Dependencies on existing task management features and Notion integration tickets.
- Potential risks include misunderstanding the Notion API's behavior and the implications of committing without pushing.
- Future enhancements could involve automating the push process or logging commit actions.
